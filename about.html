        About Rainbow Refuge
      </h1>
      <h2>
        Rainbow Refuge is a coalition of queer people and allies all across the United States 
        focused on helping LGBTQIA+ 
      </h2>
      <h2>
        youth and adults get out of cities and states that are becoming increasingly dangerous.
      </h2>
      <p>
        We are an ever growing group of over 150 people that are able to assist with everything 
        from packing up and moving out to finding a safe place to live and a stable job in a new home.
        Nobody wants to leave the place they call home, but the truth is that many of our members
        didn't have much of a choice. With all of the laws being passed in places like Florida and  
        Texas, queer people all over the US are faced with the choice to either hide their sexuality 
        or leave; and anyone who has ever had to hide who they are understands that there are more
        important things in life than simply living.
